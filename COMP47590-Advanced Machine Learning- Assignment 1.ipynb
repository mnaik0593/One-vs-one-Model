    "According to the accuracy scores and cross validation scores for the given dataset k-Fold ensemble with logistic regression as the stack classifier is gives the best performance.\n",
    "Below are some observations,\n",
    "•\tIn decision tree, the best fit model gives an accuracy score of 74% but we can get an increased performance if multiple classifiers are used which decreases the error rate.\n",
    "•\tIn bagging multiple classifiers are used to perform predictions and then the final decision is made based on aggregation. The best fit model gives an accuracy score of 84.25% but still the results can be more accurate if we use a classifier instead of the aggregation of all the classifiers.\n",
    "•\tWhen we use simple stacked ensemble classifier the cross validation scores are 81% but since we are using same data for training the base classifiers as well as the stacked ensembles there are chances of over-fitting.\n",
    "•\tTo avoid this over-fitting problem, we use the Hold out ensemble or ensemble with k-fold though the approaches for both the classifiers are quite similar the ensemble with k-fold gives a better with accuracy score of around 85% , but if the dimensionalities are increased than the k-fold ensemble will face two major drawbacks. First is, increased training time. Second is, increased memory space which is used in training process. Also if dimensionalities are increased than the accuracy decreased in case of these classifiers.\n",
    "•\tThe one vs one model is the best model as each of the classifiers are specialised to classify only 2 classes, this helps us to overcome both the disadvantages of k-fold ensembles as the memory and training time is decreased tremendously.  Also, the accuracy score of this classifier is 80.25% and can perform well if the number of dimensionalities is increased. \n"
